# Todo List Project

## Overview

Developed as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript [course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript), it allows users to create todos with a title, description, due date, and priority. Todos can be categorized into different projects edited and deleted.

## Concepts worked

- "Vanilla" JavaScript ES6 for organizing js source code in modules and classes.
- Separating application logic from DOM-related stuff.
- webpack for bundling.
- use of the browser's Web Storage API to persist todos between sessions.
- JSON manipulation.
- TailwindCSS for styling.

## Building and Running the Project

- Requires Node.js installed on your system.
- In the project directory in your terminal and run `npm install` to install required dependencies.
- Run `npm run build` to bundle the project using webpack and `npm start` to run the project locally.
